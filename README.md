### Test run
- npm run dev
- need to remove the cdn and use the tailwind plugin for production 
### Bugs and Features
- For the case of lambda=-1 and beta =pi/4 the visuzlation doesnt show any place with red where the it is maximum (check color plotting with tauxy maybe error in web gl integration) (check the new formual again for tou and confirm the derivation )

- memoization (partially done) still needs to be done for edge extrema and others

- Do i keep the min max dots, as it is found by brute force method and it doesnt add any significant value as sometimes there are multiple poitns where the min and max values are the same
